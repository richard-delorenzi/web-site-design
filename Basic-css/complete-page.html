          This is your <em>home</em>, itâ€™s the only one youâ€™ve got.
          <a href="#Saturn">Saturn</a> is pretty, but you canâ€™t live there, you canâ€™t even get there.
          So, I repeat, this is your home.
          Itâ€™s the only one youâ€™ve got.
          Cherish it, protect it, itâ€™s the only one youâ€™re gonna get.
          These guys, theyâ€™re your neighbors, they ainâ€™t goinâ€™ away, they ainâ€™t leavinâ€™.
          You have to get along with them, so you have to learn to share.
          You have to get along, you have to learn to get along.
          Because they are your neighbors, theyâ€™re not goinâ€™ away.
          Okay, all this stuffâ€”
          The animals, the water, the sky, the ground, the bugs, the fish, the tacos, the peopleâ€”
          Theyâ€™re all connected; Everything is connected.
          They all depend on one another.
          If you ignore that, youâ€™re doomed, repeat, doomed.
          OK, So, listen up: itâ€™s all one,
          Not two worlds, not three; one, just one.
          So get in gear.
          Remember, all is one.

        <h3>Life on Earth</h3>
        <p>
          Earth contains life, some people think it contains

          It has nice rings. It is very very big, and a long way away. If you could get there, then you could not land. However it does have at least 82 moons. Good luck living on them.
