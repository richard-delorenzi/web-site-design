        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is our home planet. It is an astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.

        <h2>Life on Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth contains life, some people think it contains intelligent life. However this is yet to be independently verified. </p>

      <h2>Space</h2>
      <p>Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space.</p>
