# Learning to create web pages with `HTML` and `CSS`

## Prerequisites
You are expected to have learnt how to do the following using `markdown`

* Headings
* Bullet lists
* Number lists
* Links
* Include images

You will need a web-browser, and a good text-editor (`notepad++` is good, `notepad` is not good).

## What
You will first learn `HTML`. We will start with the basics: just the stuff that could have been done with `markdown`.

You will then learn some more `HTML`: stuff to help structure the document.

Then you will learn how to style the document with `CSS`.

Then how to lay the document out with `CSS`.

## How

Start my looking at the examples bellow, in reverse order (we want to know where we are going, then to see how we will get there).

### Sample web-pages
* [Simple html initial: to be fixed by student](1-Simple_HTML/page.html)
* [Basic HTML initial: to be fixed by student](2-Basic-HTML/page.html)
* [Basic HTML complete: can be explored and added to by student](2-Basic-HTML/complete-page.html)
* [Basic css complete: to be explored and added to by student ](3-Basic-css/complete-page.html)
* [With layout: to be explored and added to by student](4-web-layout/web-layout.html)

### Setup
Now go to the [Project page](https://github.com/richard-delorenzi/web-site-design), and download the website.

### Simple `HTML`
When you have downloaded the site, go into `1-Simple_HTML` (use a file explorer to do this). Open your text editor (`notepad++`), and drag the file into it. The code will appear in front of you. Then drag the file into your web-browser. You will see the Â½ finished site. 

Your job is to fix the page: the writer got mixed up, and did some of it in `markdown` you need to convert to `HTML`. You can find examples of everything that you need on the page.

What you will know by the end of the lesson:

* How to do headings in `HTML`.
* How to do bullet points in `HTML`.
* What `HTML` tags look like `<>`.
* What a start tag looks like `<â€¦>`.
* What an end tag looks like `</â€¦>`.

###Basic HTML
You have already downloaded everything (don't do that again).
Go into `2-Basic_HTML` (use a file explorer to do this). Open your text editor (`notepad++`), and drag the file into it. The code will appear in front of you. Then drag the file into your web-browser. You will see the Â½ finished site.

Your job is to fix the page: the writer got mixed up, and did some of it in `markdown` you need to convert to `HTML`. You can find examples of everything that you need on the page.

This time you will so a little structure, including code to add style (it reads it from a file, we will ignore it until next lesson).

When you have done, find out how to: (w3-schools may be of help)

1. add an image.
1. make a link ( to a wikipedia page).
1. do a number list.

### Basic css
You know the drill, but this time it is the directory `3-Basic-css`.
