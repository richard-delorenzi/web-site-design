# Learning to create web pages with `HTML` and `CSS`

## Prerequisites
You are expected to have learnt how to do the following using `markdown`

* Headings
* Bullet lists
* Number lists
* Links
* Include images

You will need a web-browser, and a good text-editor (`notepad++` is good, `notepad` is not good).

## What
You will first learn `HTML`. We will start with the basics: just the stuff that could have been done with `markdown`.

You will then learn some more `HTML`: stuff to help structure the document.

Then you will learn how to style the document with `CSS`.

Then how to lay the document out with `CSS`.

## How

Start my looking at the examples bellow, in reverse order (we want to know where we are going, then to see how we will get there).

### Sample web-pages
* [Simple html initial: to be fixed by student](1-Simple_HTML/page.html)
* [Basic HTML initial: to be fixed by student](2-Basic-HTML/page.html)
* [Basic HTML complete: can be explored and added to by student](2-Basic-HTML/complete-page.html)
* [Basic css complete: to be explored and added to by student ](3-Basic-css/complete-page.html)
* [With layout: to be explored and added to by student](4-web-layout/web-layout.html)

Now go to the [Project page](https://github.com/richard-delorenzi/web-site-design), and download the website.
